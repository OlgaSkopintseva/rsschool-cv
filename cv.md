## About Me
At the moment, my main goal is to take RS School courses and expand my skills in the field of Frontend development. At the same time, I am also learning English in order to be able to enter the international market in the future.

My strengths include perseverance, a willingness to analyze and solve problems, and a desire to gain new knowledge. Although at the moment I am still quite a beginner and I have practically no work experience, this will not interfere with my desire for learning and development. On the contrary, I have a bright goal to which I can aspire.
